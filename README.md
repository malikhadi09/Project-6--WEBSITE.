# Objective:
The main aim of our project was to create a website through which the user could visit websites of different genres in one place by using the knowledge of web development that we gained in the ICT course and through the internet.

# Project Description:
The final product of our project was a website. We demonstrated our front-end development skills in this project. It was a non-responsive website, as we were at a beginner level of web development. The website was capable enough of letting the user navigate backwards and forward. The website consisted of a homepage and other web pages directed from the homepage. The web pages consisted of a header that allowed users to move towards various sections of the page and a footer that had functional logos of various social media handles and a button that takes the user to the top of the page. The homepage consisted of an about section, a team section and a dummy responsive section. The other pages could be reachable by clicking the mentioned button in the section below the header of the home page. On the other web pages, there was information about the websites of that specific genre. One could easily visit the websites by clicking the name or the images of the mentioned websites.
